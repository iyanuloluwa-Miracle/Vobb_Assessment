# Vobb Backend Accessment

Build a simple RESTful API for a car dealership to manage cars, categories, and customers.

## üîó Quick Links

- **Live API**: [https://vobb-api.render.com](https://vobb-assessment.onrender.com)
- **API Documentation**: [Postman Collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29992846/2sB2qgcxL8) 

## üöÄ Features

- User Authentication (JWT-based)
- Role-based Authorization (Managers & Customers)
- Car Management System
- Category Management
- Customer Management
- Secure Password Hashing
- TypeScript Support
- MongoDB Integration
- Environment Variables Configuration

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas account)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vobb.git
   cd vobb
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```
   Replace the placeholders with your actual values.

   To generate a secure JWT secret, you can use this command:
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Start production server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## üîí Security

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Input validation and sanitization
- Role-based access control

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

### Test Results Summary
![Test Coverage Results](./images/test-cases.png)

- **Total Test Suites**: 3
- **Total Tests**: 24
  - ‚úÖ Passed: 17 tests
  - ‚ùå Failed: 7 tests (related to Car Service timeouts)
- **Test Categories**:
  - Authentication Service: All tests passed
  - Category Service: All tests passed (8 tests)
  - Car Service: Timeout issues being resolved

### Test Coverage
```
---------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-----------------
File                 | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines |
---------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-----------------
All files           |   68.01 |     32.6 |   58.53 |   69.23 |
 models             |   89.18 |        0 |     100 |   94.28 |
 services           |   63.78 |    34.09 |   54.05 |   63.26 |
```

Key highlights:
- Models have excellent coverage (89.18% statements, 100% functions)
- Authentication tests are passing successfully
- Category management tests are comprehensive and passing
- Car service tests need timeout configuration adjustment

Note: Car service tests are timing out due to MongoDB Memory Server configuration, which is being addressed. All other functionality tests are passing successfully.
