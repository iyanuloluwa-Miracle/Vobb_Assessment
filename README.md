## üîó Quick Links

- **Live API**: [https://vobb-api.render.com](https://vobb-api.render.com) (Update this link once deployed)
- **API Documentation**: [Postman Collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/your-collection-id) (Update this link once created)

## üöÄ Features

- User Authentication (JWT-based)
- Role-based Authorization (Managers & Customers)
- Car Management System
- Category Management
- Customer Management
- Secure Password Hashing
- TypeScript Support
- MongoDB Integration
- Environment Variables Configuration

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas account)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vobb.git
   cd vobb
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```
   Replace the placeholders with your actual values.

   To generate a secure JWT secret, you can use this command:
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Start production server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
